title: Semi-bandit Optimization in the Dispersed Setting
abstract: The goal of data-driven algorithm design is to obtain high-performing algorithms
  for specific application domains using machine learning and data. Across many fields
  in AI, science, and engineering, practitioners will often fix a family of parameterized
  algorithms and then optimize those parameters to obtain good performance on example
  instances from the application domain.  In the online setting, we must choose algorithm
  parameters for each instance as they arrive, and our goal is to be competitive with
  the best fixed algorithm in hindsight.There are two major challenges in online data-driven
  algorithm design. First, it can be computationally expensive to evaluate the loss
  functions that map algorithm parameters to performance, which often require the
  learner to run a combinatorial algorithm to measure its performance. Second, the
  losses can be extremely volatile and have sharp discontinuities. However, we show
  that in many applications, evaluating the loss function for one algorithm choice
  can sometimes reveal the loss for a range of similar algorithms, essentially for
  free. We develop online optimization algorithms capable of using this kind of extra
  information by working in the semi-bandit feedback setting. Our algorithms achieve
  regret bounds that are essentially as good as algorithms under full-information
  feedback and are significantly more computationally efficient. We apply our semi-bandit
  results to obtain the first provable guarantees for data-driven algorithm design
  for linkage-based clustering and we improve the best regret bounds for designing
  greedy knapsack algorithms.
