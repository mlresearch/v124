title: Skewness Ranking Optimization for Personalized Recommendation
abstract: "{In this paper, we propose a novel optimization criterion that leverages
  features of the skew normal distribution to better model the problem of personalized
  recommendation. Specifically, the developed criterion borrows the concept and the
  flexibility of the skew normal distribution, based on which three hyperparameters
  are attached to the optimization criterion. Furthermore, from a theoretical point
  of view, we not only establish the relation between the maximization of the proposed
  criterion and the shape parameter in the skew normal distribution, but also provide
  the analogies and asymptotic analysis of the proposed criterion to maximization
  of the area under the ROC curve. Experimental results conducted on a range of large-scale
  real-world datasets show that our model significantly outperforms the state of the
  art and yields consistently best performance on all tested datasets.}"
