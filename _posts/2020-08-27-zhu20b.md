title: 'Semi-Supervised Learning: the Case When Unlabeled Data is Equally Useful'
abstract: "{Semi-supervised learning algorithms attempt to take advantage of relatively
  inexpensive unlabeled data to improve learning performance. In this work, we consider
  statistical models where the data distributions can be characterized by continuous
  parameters. We show that under certain conditions on the distribution, unlabeled
  data is equally useful as labeled date in terms of learning rate. Specifically,
  let $n, m$ be the number of labeled and unlabeled data, respectively. It is shown
  that the learning rate of semi-supervised learning scales as $O(1/n)$ if $m\\sim
  n$, and scales as $O(1/n^{1+\\gamma})$ if $m\\sim n^{1+\\gamma}$ for some $\\gamma>0$,
  whereas the learning rate of supervised learning scales as $O(1/n)$. }"
